                When you add funds to your Game to Give™ balance, you're making an irrevocable donation to the Earn to Give Charitable Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. This means that no player can materially benefit from winning a game, as funds can only be transferred between balances and ultimately to charity. As a player, you can either gift your balance to any of the 1.7M eligible charities in the USA or use that balance to play a game.

                Here's an example... John signs up and adds funds to his Game to Give™ balance by making a $100 donation to the Earn to Give Charitable Fund. He finds a game where his favorite team has a 40% chance of winning and pays $4.00 from his balance to submit a pick. His friend, Steve, bets on the opposing team and pays $6.00 since his team has a 60% chance of winning. When John's team wins the game, Earn to Give™ will automatically transfer the $10 max reward (less any processing fees) to John's Game to Give™ balance. John's balance is now greater than the amount he originally contributed, meaning he has more funds to positively impact the charities of his choice.

                Absolutely! In fact, it's encouraged. When you add funds to your Game to Give™ balance, you're making an irrevocable donation to the Earn to Give Charitable Fund, a 501(c)(3) donor advised fund. From there, you can choose to which charities you would like Earn to Give Charitable Fund to distribute your funds.

                We encourage you to speak to a licensed tax professional, but when you add funds to Game to Give™, you're making an irrevocable donation to the Earn to Give Charitable Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organized as a donor advised fund. Since this entity meets the IRS qualitications for tax deductibility, you may be able to deduct your contributions. Note that only the funds you add to Game to Give™ may be eligible for a tax deduction; the grants you request thereafter are not eligible for a second deduction.

              Game to Give™ is a free platform aimed at catalyzing generosity through games that are fun. While using the platform and playing the games are free, there is a small transfer fee added to move the funds from the loser's balanace to the winner's balance at the end of the game. This fee helps to make it possible for us to process fee-free grants to charity!
