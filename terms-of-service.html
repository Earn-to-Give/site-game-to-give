Any use of the Content not expressly permitted by these Terms and Conditions of Use is a breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws. Content and features, including without limitation product pricing and availability, are subject to change or termination without notice in the sole discretion of the Company. Content may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to the Company and its licensors.</p>
              <p>If you violate any of these Terms and Conditions of Use, your permission to use the Content may be terminated in the sole discretion of the Company, and in such event you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content.</p>
        <h3>Use of the Services.</h3>
              <p>In your use of the Services, you agree to act responsibly in a manner demonstrating the exercise of good judgment. For example and without limitation, you agree not to (a) use the Services for any purpose in violation of local, state, national, or international laws, (b) insert your own or a third party’s advertising, branding, or other promotional content into any of the Content or use, redistribute, republish, or exploit the Content for any further commercial or promotional purposes, (c) infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or contractual rights, (d) engage in spidering, “screen scraping,” “database scraping,” harvesting of e-mail addresses, wireless addresses, or other contact or personal information, or any other automatic means of obtaining lists of users or other information from or through the Services, including without limitation any information residing on any server or database connected to the Services, (e) interfere with, interrupt, damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Services or the Content, including, without limitation, through the use of viruses, cancel bots, Trojan horses, harmful code, flood pings, denial of service attacks, packet or IP spoofing, forged routing, or electronic mail address information or similar methods or technology, (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems through the Services, or (g) assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.</p>

              <p>THE SERVICES ARE NOT A FORM OF GAMBLING AND MAY NOT BE USED FOR ANY FORM OF GAMBLING.</p>
              <p>If for any reason the Services are not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Website or the App becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of the Company corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Services), the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the Services. If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Website.</p>
